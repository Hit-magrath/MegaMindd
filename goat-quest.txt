Here is the revised game script, focused on memory, critical thinking, and reading for meaning, with a new storyline and image order.

The Quest for the Missing Goats
Game Concept: Sipho, a young boy from a rural village in KwaZulu-Natal, discovers his family's goats are missing and he needs to find them before sunset. The player guides Sipho on an interactive quest to find them, using his wits and memory to solve puzzles along the way.

Player: Thato, a responsible and clever young boy.
Setting: A small, vibrant village in rural KwaZulu-Natal.


Scene 1: The Clues
The sun was just peeking over the hills, painting the sky with colors of pink and orange. Thato, a boy of 14, woke up with a big smile. It was his job to take the family's three goats to the grazing field. He walked out of his hut and headed to the kraal. But when he looked inside, his smile 
disappeared. The kraal was empty.

Script: 
Sipho: "Haibo, I was ready to greet the goats this morning, but they are gone! I need to ask Gogo if she has seen them. This is not good."


Scene 2: The Grandmother's Clue
Script: 
Sipho: "Gogo! The goats are gone! Have you seen them?"

Gogo looked at him with kind eyes. "Don't you worry, my brave Sipho. I saw them this morning. They were drinking water near the river, and they were eating by the big fig tree."

Sipho nodded. He had to remember those two places: the river and the big fig tree. That was his first clue.(Highlight the two clues)


Scene 3: The Distraction Test
On the way to the river, you meet your friend Zanele who says:
“Sipho, come play soccer with us! You worry too much about goats.”

Choices:
Stay focused and go to the river. ✅ (Attention maintained)
Play soccer. ❌ (Leads to time wasted, goats may be lost by nightfall).
Create buttons that show the two options that the player can choose from


Scene 4: The Logic Puzzle
The tracks split into two: one path goes north to the hills, the other goes east to the fig tree.

Reasoning challenge:
You recall Gogo Thandi mentioned goats by the fig tree.

Which path do you choose?
Choices:
North to the hills (danger: lose goats to hyenas).

East to the fig tree (correct: you find two goats grazing).


Scene 5: The Discovery
Now you have 2 goats, but one is still missing. A farmer, Mr. Dlamini, says:
“I saw one goat earlier near the… hmm… was it the maize field, or by the soccer ground? Wait, maybe it was close to the school?”

Recall Test:
Earlier, you ignored/remembered that the maize field was not part of Gogo Thandi’s original clue.

Correct reasoning: check the school, since goats often wander there.


Scene 6: The Return Home
Sipho walked to the school, and sure enough, there was his last goat, grazing by the fence. He carefully brought all three goats back home as the sun began to set.

Gogo was waiting for him, and when she saw him she smiled a wide, beautiful smile. She gave him a big hug.

"Sipho, my heart is full," she said. "Thank you for finding the goats and bringing them home."

The AI Bot companion says:

“Great job, Sipho! You remembered 3 locations, ignored distractions, and solved the tracks puzzle. Your score: Memory 3/3, Attention 1/1, Reasoning 1/1.”
